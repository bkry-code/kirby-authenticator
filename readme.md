# Kirby Authenticator (Beta) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pedroborges/kirby-authenticator.svg)](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-authenticator/releases) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/pedroborges/kirby-authenticator.svg)](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-authenticator/issues)

Improved authentication system with 2-step verification for Kirby CMS.

[![Click to watch a short clip of the Authenticator plugin in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedroborges/pedroborges/kirby-authenticator/master/preview.gif)](https://jumpshare.com/v/gGVqJuIYQ3JV7Hqj99GA)

## Main features
- 2-step verification
- Password reset (soon)
- Password-less login via email (soon)
- Custom login layout (soon)
- Your turn...

## Basic Usage
Once installed, Authenticator will automatically register the necessary users blueprint to activate the plugin. If your project already have a [default users blueprint](https://getkirby.com/docs/panel/users#custom-user-form-fields), you will need to add the field below to `site/blueprints/users/default.yml`:

```yaml
fields:
  authenticator:
    type: authenticator
```

Then you can login, go to `https://your-site.com/panel/users/[username]/edit`, and scroll to the **2-step verification** section. From there you can turn 2-step verification on/off by clicking on the button on the right and following the instructions.

This plugin is still in _beta_ and there are [some features](#roadmap) that I'd like to complete. That doesn't mean it's buggy, all implemented features should work well. It just doesn't have all the features I have planned for it yet. I'd appreciate if you can test it and give feedback.
